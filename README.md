# data-exploration-with-missing-migrants-dataset


In this notebook, I explore and visualise data from the Missing Migrants Project. The [Missing Migrants Project](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/) "tracks incidents involving migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have died or gone missing in the process of migration towards an international destination."

I would recommend viewing this notebook at this link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggleuser654/missing-migrants-data-exploration) as Folium maps have trouble loading on GitHub.

Before I began visualising the data, I dealt with the missing values for the features that I wanted to use, so please scroll down to the charts/plots.

I used the Folium library to create a annotated Marker Cluster map and a HeatMap, the Seaborn library for bar and line graphs, and the regular expression library to find and extract strings in order to create a WordCloud.

Exploring this dataset is sobering and eye opening.
